# SMS Spam Detection

## Overview
The **SMS Spam Detection** project is a machine learning initiative that classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam. Developed in Python, this model utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze text content and make accurate predictions. It is deployed on the web using Streamlit, providing an interactive user interface for easy access.

## Technology Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for model development and data processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building web applications.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes the SMS Spam Collection dataset from Kaggle.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles null values, duplicates, and formats data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes dataset patterns and visualizes insights.
- **Model Building and Selection**: Tests various algorithms to find the best performer.
- **Web Deployment**: Accessible web interface for users to classify SMS messages.

## Conclusion
The SMS Spam Detection project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline, from data collection to web deployment. It showcases the potential of machine learning in practical applications, providing a robust solution for SMS classification.
